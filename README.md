# mcmc-visualizer
A web app that visualizes the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) recombination algorithm on a grid.

Currently does a random walk from the center of the grid (based on # of steps input) and displays end position as a red dot.
Goal: Make a tool to easily visualize and mess around with a Recom algorithm that works similiar to gerrychain to build intuition.
